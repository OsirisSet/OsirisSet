Set of Osiris

Greetings, my name is Osiris sET and I'm a web and software engineer from California. I like working on a wide range of projects, ranging from simple websites to complicated web application development. I'm always studying new technologies and striving to better my overall abilities.

I am really interested in open source software and in making a contribution to the development community in general. My experience with GitHub spans several years, during which time I've made several contributions to a variety of projects. I'm also a member of the jQuery project, where I've worked on the development of jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile, to name a few projects.

In the event that you're seeking for a web or software developer that has a great interest in open source software, you've discovered the individual you were looking for. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any queries or would want to discuss a potential project.
